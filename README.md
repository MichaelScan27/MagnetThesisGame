Hi, I'm Michael Scandiffio and this is my Magnet-based Puzzle-platform Video Game 
that I created as part of my Honors Thesis project.  If you are reading this, then
that means I've sent you a copy of the demo I created to give feedback on or you are
viewing the final result of the project.

I would like to thank you very much for taking time out of your day to view
my project, it means so much and your feedback and attention is immensely appreciated.  

The game is a first-person-perspective puzzle-platformer heavily inspired by the 2007
video-game Portal.  In this demo, you have a device that can modify the polarities of
magnetic cubes.  You interact with these cubes using this device to solve puzzles and
get to the end of each room.

The contents of the repository include:
- A Windows-compatible .EXE inside of a .ZIP
- A MacOS-compatible .APP inside of a .ZIP
- The original Godot project folder I create the game in, that can be opened in the
	Godot Engine application if desired.  Can also be used to compile the project.
- This README
- The full companion paper to this project as a .PDF document.



If you are running a version of Windows on your computer, you can run the game from the
.EXE inside the WINDOWS.ZIP

If you are running a version of MacOS, unzip the .ZIP inside 'MAC_OS', then you can run
the game from the .APP inside MAC_OS.ZIP

On MacOS, if the application fails to run, you may need to allow it through
GateKeeper.

1. Go to System Settings > Privacy & Security > Security
2. Enable 'Allow anyway' next to a message indicating that MichaelScandiffio-
		MagnetThesisGame.APP was not allowed to run
3. Launch MichaelScandiffio-MagnetThesisGame.APP again


When the game is running, you can use either a keyboard and mouse to play, or a 
controller connected to the computer.  The controls are listed below:

The game includes light text-based directions and no audio.  If you have issue
opening or running the game, please email me at michaelscandiffio@mail.adelphi.edu.

The game consists of four puzzles, after which you are placed in a sandbox environment
where you can experiment if you would like.  After you have completed the game, please
read the accompanying paper that details my development process and overall design
decisions.  I look forward to receiving your feedback on both of these components.

Thank you for viewing this project!

-Michael Scandiffio.
