Hi, I'm Michael Scandiffio and this is my Magnet-based Puzzle-platform Video Game 
that I created as part of my Honors Thesis project.  If you are reading this, then
that means I've sent you a copy of the demo I created to give feedback on or you are
viewing the final result of the project.

I would like to thank you very much for taking time out of your day to view

The contents of the repository include:
- A Windows-compatible .EXE inside of 'WINDOWS'

- The original Godot project folder I create the game in, that can be opened in the
	Godot Engine application if desired.
- This README
- The full companion paper to this project as a .PDF document.
